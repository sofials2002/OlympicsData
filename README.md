From GDP to Gold Medals: How Economic Factors and Sports Funding Affect Olympic Outcomes

With this project, I'm analyzing Olympics data to explore relationships between gold medals, GDP, sports investment and overall athlete performance. ◯‍◯‍◯‍◯‍◯

# Introduction (unofficial): 
The Olympics are happening... again. Time flies, and it's impressive to see how Paris was able to pull off such an extravagant opening ceremony, and have everything ready on time, while still having a lower budget than the past olympics. Other than watching the games, I've wondered 

# Previous Studies:
Research on this topic is not uncommon. Studies have explored relationships between sports funding and Olympic performance, and there is some literature on how GDP correlates with the number of medals. For instance, some research has shown that wealthier countries tend to perform better in the Olympics due to better facilities, training, and athlete support.

# Key Findings:
Generally, wealthier countries tend to perform better, but this is influenced by a variety of factors, including investment in sports infrastructure, coaching quality, and national sports policies. There is also evidence that countries with higher incentives and better sports funding tend to achieve more success in international competitions.
